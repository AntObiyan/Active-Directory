## Introduction
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It manages and organizes network resources like users, computers, and devices, making it easier to control access and security within a network. AD stores data as objects, such as user accounts or computers, and helps administrators control permissions, authenticate users, and enforce security policies. It also enables centralized management of resources, making it a core tool for organizations to streamline IT tasks, automate processes, and ensure secure, efficient operations across large networks.
